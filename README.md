# EARTH_QUAKE-PREDICTION
Built an earthquake prediction model using neural networks to forecast magnitude and depth based on timestamp, latitude, and longitude.  Visualized earthquake frequency on a world map for geographic insights into seismic activity.  Processed and split earthquake data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets for model validation.
